# fresh_debian_container_with_ssh
Runs a fresh Debian container which is ready to ssh into.

To test the deployment process of my web applications, I like
to deploy into a Docker container which runs a fresh Debian
instance. Since deployment runs over SSH, the host needs to
be able to ssh into the container.

This script automates the steps needed to get there.
